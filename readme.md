Rot3D
=====
This is a test program focusing on Rodrigues formula which depict the relationship 
between the rotation vector and the rotation matrix. In mathematics, the special 
orthogonal group in dimension 3 (**SO3**) is the group of all rotations about the 
origin of three-dimensional Euclidean space **R<sup>3</sup>**.

Generally, the computation cost of Cayley formula is much sheaper than the others.
